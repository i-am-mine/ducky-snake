# Task to complete

## Graphic
- Upgrade the graphic from TUI to GUI
    - Study Qt framework ?
    - Qt:



## Feature
- Create, or integrate, a random food location generator
    - Currently, the food randomness is done with `rand() % size of gameframe`
    - Idea: use Procedural Generation?
- Mother duck -> Egg -> Ducklings
- Beside food, insert obstacles: poisonous mushrooms, cactus ...
- Set up the game levels
- Replace control buttons W A S D with arrow buttons ?

## Bug
- When the user controls the ducks in the opposite direction, the display fails. Logically, the ducklings are led by the mother duck, so the reverse movement should not happen.
